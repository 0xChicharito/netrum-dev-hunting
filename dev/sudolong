Why Join?:  
With solid experience in infrastructure and blockchain testnets, I want to contribute tools and documentation that help new developers onboard easily.  
I also work with JavaScript/TypeScript-based tools, and believe Netrumâ€™s AI x infra vision aligns with my values of openness and education.
